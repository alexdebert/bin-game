### Quick start

#### 1. Run `npm install`

This will install all dependencies (listed in `package.json`) necessary to get you up and running.

#### 2. Run `npm start`

This will start [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) to serve up your application.
You should see your default browser open up a window pointing to `localhost:9000`.
